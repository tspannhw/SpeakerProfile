## Apache Pulsar 102:  The Basics 

In this talk, we will walk step by step through Apache Pulsar from the first topic to first application.   I will include slides, articles and examples to 
take away as a Quick Start to utilizing Apache Kafka in your real-time dataflows.   I will help you get up and running locally on your laptop, 
Docker, Kubernetes or cloud native with StreamNative Cloud.
