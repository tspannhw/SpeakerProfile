## 2022


Like last year, it seems like a good idea to track where I may be speaking or demoing.

If you want me to speak at your conference, take a look at my speaker profile and some of the talks I have developed.

Devfest uk & ireland using apache nifi with apache pulsar for fast data on-ramp 2022

As the Pulsar communities grows, more and more connectors will be added. To enhance the availability of sources and sinks and to make use of the greater Apache Streaming community, joining forces between Apache NiFi and Apache Pulsar is a perfect fit. Apache NiFi also adds the benefits of ELT, ETL, data crunching, transformation, validation and batch data processing. Once data is ready to be an event, NiFi can launch it into Pulsar at light speed.

I will walk through how to get started, some use cases and demos and answer questions.
