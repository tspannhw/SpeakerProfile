## 2022


Like last year, it seems like a good idea to track where I may be speaking or demoing.

If you want me to speak at your conference, take a look at my speaker profile and some of the talks I have developed.

So far, these are coming up as of 04-December-2021:

I will be speaking about StreamNative and Apache Pulsar coming up.
