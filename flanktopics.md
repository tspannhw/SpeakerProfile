### Real-Time Stock Processing With Apache NiFi, Apache Flink and Apache Kafka 

We will ingest a variety of real-time feeds including stocks with NiFi, filter and process and segment it into Kafka topics. Kafka data will be in Apache Avro
format with schemas specified in Cloudera Schema Registry. Apache Flink, Kafka Connect and NiFi will do additional event processing along with machine learning 
and deep learning. We will store real-time feed data in Apache Kudu for real-time analytics and summaries. Apache OpenNLP, Apache MXNet, CoreNLP, NLTK and 
SpaCy will be used to analyse stock trend data in streams as well as stock prices and futures.   As part of the stream processing we will also be 
classifying images and stock data with Apache MXNet and DJL.

We will also produce cleaned and aggregated data to subscribers via Apache Kafka, Apache Flink SQL and Apache NiFi. We will push to applications, 
message listeners, web clients, Slack channels and to email,

To be useful in our enterprise, we will have full authorization, authentication, auditing, data encryption and data lineage via Apache Ranger, 
Apache Atlas and Apache NiFi.

### Continuous SQL with Kafka and Flink

In this talk, I will walk through how someone can setup and run continous SQL queries against Kafka topics utilizing Apache Flink. 
We will walk through creating Kafka topics, schemas and publishing data.

We will then cover consuming Kafka data, joining Kafka topics and inserting new events into Kafka topics as they arrive. This basic over view
will show hands-on techniques, tips and examples of how to do this.
